# Changelog

## 2.1.0

**If you call brand stores, pass `catalog_id`.** `.reseller.brand_stores.list({"catalog_id": catalog_id})` now returns the brand stores where PINs of that
product can be spent, so you can show a cardholder where their card works. The API refuses a call without `catalog_id`
(`422`, on that field) and one for a product that isn't yours (`404 catalog_item_not_found`).

- New: `.brand.brand_stores.list({"catalog_id": catalog_id})`, the same list for a brand selling its own PINs.
- Looking up a PIN now returns its `catalog_id`, ready to pass to brand stores.

## 2.0.0

Webhook checks follow AfroPin's new webhook signature, and the old one is no longer sent. `webhooks.parse()` and `webhooks.verify()`
now take (raw_body, headers, secret), check `webhook-signature` (the HMAC-SHA256 of `id.timestamp.body`) and refuse a
`webhook-timestamp` more than 5 minutes from now. The event comes back with its `id`, the same on every retry.

## 1.1.0

`pins.set_delivery()` (POST pins/delivery) chooses who delivers a PIN's codes to its customer. Selling a PIN or
activating a printed card takes `handle_delivery` in place of the platform webhook URL, which is gone.

## 1.0.0

First release: every brand and reseller endpoint of the AfroPin API v1, request signing, idempotency keys, pages for
lists, one error type with the API's error codes, and webhook signature checks.
